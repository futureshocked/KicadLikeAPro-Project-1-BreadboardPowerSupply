# Kicad Like a Pro Project 1: A Breadboard Power Supply

This is the first project from the book and video course [Kicad Like a Pro](https://techexplorations.com/so/kicada/). It implements a simple breadboard power supply.

In this project, you will use all of Kicad’s main features that you learned about in Parts 2 and 3 of the book. Particularly, you will learn:

1.How to design a schematic of your board in Eeschema

2.How to design a layout for your board with externally-imposed physical restrictions

3.How to take measurements that relate to the board’s mechanical specifications and used them to design the board outline

4.How to apply the linear schematic design workflow in a real project

5.How to apply the linear layout design workflow in a real project

6.How to select symbols from the library, and associate them with footprints

7.How to manually route the board

8.How to manufacture the board using an online manufacturer

This repository contains multiple commits at each step of the design process, as Peter was going through it. 
Feel free to clone this repository on your computer and make any modifications you feel like.

This project is the first complete and realistic one in this book. 

You will learn to use Kicad’s most important functions, and experience a simplified version of the PCB design process. 

In this project, you will build a double-sided PCB for a 5V power supply. 

You will be able to use this power supply to power your breadboard Arduino projects, or any project that requires a 5V power 
supply. As an input to your power supply, you can use an old DC or AC walled power supply, as long as its output voltage does 
not exceed 35V.

In the process of designing your power supply, you will learn all the skills you need to create PCBs of comparable complexity.

You will not learn everything there is to know in Kicad; you will not suddenly become an experienced PCB designer. 

But, you will have the opportunity to apply the principles you learned in Part 3, and create a respectable board.
